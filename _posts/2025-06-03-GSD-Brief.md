**Project Type:** GSD (Get Stuff Done)  
**Timeline:** 2 weeks for prototype  
**Owner:** {{site.author.name}}

## Problem Statement

There is significant inefficiency in managing communications across multiple channels (Slack, email, calendar). When conversations about the same topic or with the same person span different platforms, important context and action items get lost.

For example, when meeting invites are accepted in calendar but rescheduling requests come through Slack, this creates confusion and wastes time searching across platforms for the complete conversation history.

This inefficiency results in:
- Lengthened response times
- Missed action items
- Frustration and decreased satisfaction with internal communications
- Increased toil in managing conversations across platforms

## Solution

Create a prototype tool using Gumloop/AI that integrates and consolidates communications across Slack, email, and calendar. The tool will:
- Match related communications across platforms
- Group conversations by participant and/or topic
- Present a unified view of all interactions with a specific person or about a specific topic
- Focus on these three platforms which should address approximately 80% of use cases

## Scope & Implementation

- **Timeline:** 2-week prototype development
- **Resources:** Self-driven project (no additional resources required)
- **Approval:** No formal approval process required
- **Dependencies:** None identified at this stage

## Success Criteria

1. **Initial validation:** Collect data through a small survey to confirm the frequency and impact of this issue among other potential users
2. **Qualitative feedback:** Gather user feedback on the prototype's effectiveness at reducing communication confusion
3. **Efficiency improvement:** While exact metrics aren't established, seek to observe and document reduction in time spent searching for information across platforms

## Next Steps

1. Design and distribute a quick survey to validate the problem exists beyond personal experience
2. Create initial prototype integrating the three communication channels
3. Test prototype with personal communications for 3-5 days
4. Refine based on findings
5. Consider expanding testing to a small group of willing colleagues
